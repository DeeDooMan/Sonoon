                    <p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! I can explain. It's very valuable. Can we have Bender Burgers again?

                        For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Say what? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

                        I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Noooooo! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

                        Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Really?!</p>

Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p>
